Cinder-TextureStore.
===========

A helpful class to manage images loading/storing.

Based on work/code from Paul Houx.

Updated to use ci::TextureRef.

Cerated and tested with Cinder 0.8.5 and 0.8.6 on Mac/Xcode.
Currently most likely not compatible with Windows.


Work in progress /  Todo:
--------
 * fix asynchronous loading of a whole folder
 * clean up code and comments
 * add block xml file
 * add samples
