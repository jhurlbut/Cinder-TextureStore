Cinder-TextureStore.
===========

A helpful class to manage images loading/storing.

Based on work/code from Paul Houx.

Tested with Cinder's glnext-branch on Mac/Xcode.  
Currently most likely not compatible with Windows.


Work in progress /  Todo:
--------
 * fix asynchronous loading of a whole folder
 * clean up code and comments
 * add more samples
 * further QA
